night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try

(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,

End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.


See you in a bit.

However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole

sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of 
that meeting.

action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an 
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with 
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Re: Dec99 Enron North America Wholesale Volumes,"Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.

Kirit Purbhoo Resume,"Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.   


		 


Thanks,

kp

ERMS Resources,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you

for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.

reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied

core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.

Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative

As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

Doorstep RAC Direction,"Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is 
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in 
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected 
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be 
issued via email. 

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is 
one ball that can not be dropped. 

Let me know your thoughts if any.

SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

Carrie

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,

Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

League is Set,"It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!
